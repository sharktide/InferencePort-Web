        <h1>Security & Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 16 December 2025</p>
    
        <h2>Account Requirements</h2>
        <p>
            InferencePort AI <strong>does not require users to create an account</strong>.
            The application can be fully used without signing in.
        </p>
        <p>
            Signing in is optional and is only required if you choose to enable
            <strong>chat syncing across devices</strong> or other cloud-backed features.
        </p>
    
        <h2>Chat Data & Syncing</h2>
        <p>
            By default, all chats are stored <strong>locally on your device</strong>.
            When you are <strong>not signed in</strong>, no chat data is transmitted to or stored on our servers.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you <strong>sign in and explicitly enable chat syncing</strong>, your chat messages and
            conversation metadata are collected and stored securely in order to synchronize your chats
            across devices.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Chat syncing is <strong>disabled by default</strong></li>
            <li>Chats are only collected when <strong>both signed in AND syncing is enabled</strong></li>
            <li>You may disable chat syncing at any time</li>
        </ul>
